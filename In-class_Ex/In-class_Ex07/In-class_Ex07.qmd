title: "In-class Exercise 7: Emerging Hot Spot Analysis - `sfdep` methods"
---
# Notes
Compare null hypothesis (resemble complete randomness), if p-value \> alpha value, reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis (distribution more leaning towards clustering)

Do Monte Carlos methods -\> perm_test of Moran I (aggregate results obtained - how many times the null hypothesis is rejected or not rejected)

\*\*perm_test more important, no need to do single stat without simulations

For hotspots, we want to know is it cluster (higher-density area surrounded by higher-density area; lower-density area surrounded by lower-density area) or outlier (higher-density area surrounded by lower-density area)

-   control value ._ alpha value (when increased, diminishing return will be higher)

** Gi only give hot/cold class value
